**Secure, Offline-First Document Manager — Privacy Without Compromise**

Paperless+ is a privacy-first Progressive Web App (PWA) for organizing important documents securely on your device. No cloud. No accounts. No tracking. Just efficient, offline document management with reminders, search, and smart organization features.

---

## 🔒 Why Paperless+?

Most document apps rely on cloud storage or require you to give up privacy for convenience. Paperless+ takes the opposite approach: all your data stays on your device, giving you full control without sacrificing functionality.

## ✨ Key Features

- **100% Local Storage (IndexedDB)**
  - No cloud syncing. All data remains on your device.
  - Ideal for sensitive documents (IDs, health records, financial papers).

- **Smart Document Organization**
  - Add title, location, category, description, and custom tags.
  - Built-in categories: ID, Medical, Legal, Financial, and more.
  - Tag urgency (e.g., "Expires Soon", "Renewal Due") and set expiration reminders.

- **Offline-First, Always Available**
  - Works completely offline—even reminders.
  - Installable as a PWA on mobile or desktop.

- **Camera Integration**
  - Capture document photos directly in the app.
  - Images stored as base64, never uploaded or shared.

  - Document history organized with monthly visual grouping.
  - Expiration indicators for time-sensitive docs.
